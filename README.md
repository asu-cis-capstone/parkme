# ParkMe README

At Arizona State University, over 78,000 students, around 12,000 employees, and over 1 million yearly visitors make their way to campus. Luckily not all of these people drive, but with only 24,000 parking spots available on campus, parking is still a big issue. Have you ever had to drive to campus last minute and struggled to find a parking spot? Ever missed a class because you couldn’t find parking in time? Many students and visitors who park on campus experience long delays and frustration while trying to find a parking space. ParkMe hopes to help ease these frustrations. ParkMe is a mobile application that provides information regarding the number of spaces available in various lots across campus. It does this by displaying functional and easy to use information. In addition to real time parking data, the application will also allow users to view lot status’s, and be reminded as their meter time runs out. ParkMe will revolutionize how Sun Devils commute to their classes.
